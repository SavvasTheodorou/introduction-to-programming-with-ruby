# 1. Use the each method of Array to iterate over 
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# odd numbers into a new array.
puts

# 4. Append "11" to the end of the original array. Prepend "0" to the beginning.

# 5. Get rid of "11". And append a "3".

# 8. Create a Hash using both Ruby syntax styles.

puts
puts '..............'
puts

hash = { :animal => "dog" }
hash = { animal: "dog" }

# 9. Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

# 9.1. Get the value of key `:b`.
p h[:b]

# 9.2. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`
h[:e] = 5
p h

# 3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5

# h.select! { |k,v| v > 3.5 }
# p h

h.delete_if { |k,v| v < 3.5 }
p h


# 10. Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

puts
puts '..............'
puts

hash = { name: "John", cars: ["BMW", "Alfa Romeo"] }
array = [{name: "John"}, "age", {age: 35}]

# 11. Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like
# best and why.

# I like http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.4/ because of the search for methods. 
# In my opinion http://apidock.com/ is a very good source because of the examples 
# but it covers upto V1.9.x so most probably 
# I will be using http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.4/

# 12. Given the following data structures. Write a program that moves the 
# information from the array into the empty hash that applies to the correct person.

puts

# Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 12,

# probably need to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful 
# methods might be the Array shift and first methods.

# 15. Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to 
# delete all of the words that begin with an "s" in the following array.

# 16. Take the following array:

# a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
#     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

# and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
# (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using 
# Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.

# 17. What will the following program output?

hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}
